This repo is the result of the goal to see how AI, specifically Grok, can create and calculate a new Calendar and Timezone Offset where everything is relative to an unrelated Belgian techno anthem, Pump Up The Jam.

It all started with this promt to Grok 2
```
Friday 18 August 1989 was the release date of Belgian act Technotronic's single "Pump Up the Jam".  
Can you create a new date/time system based on this gregorian date being sunday, day 0, month 0, and year 0 in a new 13 month year following the rules specified here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar
Instead of a gregorian Calendar, we will call this the Philomena Calendar.
And then, can you update all timezones to make Belgian the center point?  So since Belgium is GMT+1, can we make a new timezone system called PUJT(Pump Up the Tam Time) where Belgian is PUJT+1, making GMT be PUJT-1; EST will become PUJT-6; etc
Finally, can you create an HTML and Javascript webpage that will convert the system's date and time(including timezone) to display the new Philomena Calendar Date and PUJT TimeZone offsize and time
```
